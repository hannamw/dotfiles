# Cursor Coding Standards

## Code Style Preferences
- Write clean, minimal code with minimal comments
- Avoid obvious comments like "// increment counter" or "// return result"
- Use descriptive variable and function names instead of explanatory comments

## Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks sparingly - only for genuine error conditions
- When using try/except, catch specific exceptions rather than bare except clauses
- Let errors bubble up naturally when appropriate

## General Guidelines
- Prioritize readability and simplicity

## Code Generation Rules
- Generate working code without placeholder TODOs
- Don't add boilerplate comments at the top of files
- Focus on the core functionality requested
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions about edge cases

## What NOT to do
- Don't add verbose docstrings unless specifically requested
- Don't wrap simple operations in unnecessary try/except blocks
- Don't add comments that simply restate what the code does
- Don't over-abstract simple solutions
- Don't add dummy data unless explicitly requested to do so.
